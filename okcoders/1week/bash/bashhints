The Linux Command Line, by William Shots is an excellent book on the command line available as a free PDF download. I highly recommend it.

Exercise #1

echo

mbp-phil:~ okcoders$ echo "just what I typed back to the screen"
just what I typed back to the screen

Exercise #2

pwd

mbp-phil:~ okcoders$ pwd
/Users/okcoders 

Exercise #3

ls -l \ -al....

mbp-phil:~ okcoders$ ls
Applications    Documents   Library     Music 

Exercise #4

mbp-phil:~ okcoders$ ls Documents/
OK-Coder

Exercise #5

cd 

mbp-phil:~ okcoders$ cd Documents/
mbp-phil:Documents okcoders$ pwd
/Users/okcoders/Documents

Exercise #6

mkdir

Creates a folder just like creating a new folder in the Finder or in Explorer. Pass it the name of the folder you want to create:

Exercise #7

rmdir

Removes the directory specified. Go ahead and remove the OK-Coders directory you just created

Exercise #8

touch

Changes the date modified property of a file and is often used to create an empty file. We'll normally use it to create new, empty files:

Exercise #9

rm

Remove a file or directory, that is, delete it. Remove the newfile.txt file you just created:

Exercise #10

mv

Move a file or directory. mv is also used to rename files.

Exercise #11

cp

Copy a file or directory. cp expect a source and target arguments with the following format:

cp source target

Exercise #12

cat

Concatenate and print files. cat allows us to modify files from the command line and to quickly view the contents of files. We'll learn how to modify files in a later lesson. Here is how you view the contents of a file:

Exercise #13

head

Prints the first lines of a file to the terminal. head is like cat but is used to peak at the beginning of a file:

Exercise #14

tail

Prints the last lines of a file to the terminal. tail is like cat but is used to peak at the end of a file:

Exercise #15

which

Indicates which executable will be used for a program and where it is located. Use which to confirm that you have installed a command line program:

Exercise #16

man

Displays the manual for a command, showing all the options and arguments a command takes. Use man when you're stuck!

Exercise #17

less

Shows the contents of a file or other input in segments, allowing you to scroll through them on the terminal.
