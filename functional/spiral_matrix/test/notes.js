@bling5630 as a note, if you find yourself using the
indices of an array as an integral part of the logic,
there's usually a better way to do what you want.
You almost never need to use the actual indices of an array,
and your code becomes simpler when you move away from that.
Not ramda, but the idea should be transferable:

Saw the Haskell, went to try it in JS. Found I'm beat to it.
Mine was similar, though:
